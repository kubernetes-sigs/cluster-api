## Highlights

This release contains an [important fix](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/11136) for KCP 
with Kubernetes v1.31. We recommend all users to upgrade to this release.

The fix required the introduction of a pre-terminate hook that is automatically added and managed by the KCP controller 
for KCP control plane Machines. If your control plane Machines are using Kubernetes 1.31, KCP will make sure that 
its pre-terminate hook is run last. This is done to ensure that the terminating Node has a working kubelet / Node 
while other pre-terminate hooks are executed.

More details about the issue can be found in [Drain not being performed for KCP machines with K8s v1.31.x ](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/11138).
