                                  controlPlaneEndpoint sets a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane; it
                                  can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.

                                  e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                                  assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                                  control plane instances.
                                  e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                                  NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              This will add about 40KB to userdata

                          rolloutStrategy is the RolloutStrategy to use to replace control plane machines with
                          new ones.

                              rollingUpdate is the rolling update config params. Present only if

                                  maxSurge is the maximum number of control planes that can be scheduled above or under the
                                  desired number of control planes.
                                  Value can be an absolute number 1 or 0.
                                  Defaults to 1.
                                  Example: when this is set to 1, the control plane can be scaled
                                  up immediately when the rolling update starts.
