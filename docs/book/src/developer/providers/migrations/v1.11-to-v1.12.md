# Cluster API v1.11 compared to v1.12

This document provides an overview over relevant changes between Cluster API v1.11 and v1.12 for
maintainers of providers and consumers of our Go API.

## Go version

- The minimal Go version required to build Cluster API is v1.24.x
- The Go version used by Cluster API is v1.24.x

## Dependencies

- The Controller Runtime version used by Cluster API is v0.22.x
- The version of the Kubernetes libraries used by Cluster API is v1.34.x

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

### Removals

* The `controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/kubeadm-cluster-configuration` annotation that KCP was previously setting on Machines has been removed.
  KCP used this annotation to detect if a Machine requires a rollout, this is now done via the KubeadmConfig of the Machine instead.

### API Changes

### Other

* `util.IsOwnedByObject`, `util.IsControlledBy` and `collections.OwnedMachines` now also require `schema.GroupKind` as input parameter.
  `schema.GroupKind` is needed for cases where typed objects are passed in because controller-runtime does not guarantee that GVK is set on typed objects.

### Suggested changes for providers

* For providers that copied the core Cluster API v1beta1 `APIEndpoint` struct and used it in their InfraCluster Go type 
  it is recommended to now make the `Host` and `Port` fields optional (they already have been made optional in 
  `clusterv1beta1.APIEndpoint` in Cluster API v1.12).
  tl;dr The fields were previously required, but due to side effects that validation was never enforced. These side
  effects might go away which then makes the fields suddenly required. To avoid issues we recommend making the fields
  optional. Similar to how they are optional in the v1beta2 `APIEndpoint` struct and v1beta2 InfraCluster contract.
  For more details, please see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/12634#discussion_r2275468291.
  But this might look differently depending on how your InfraCluster Go type and corresponding mutating webhook evolved over time.
