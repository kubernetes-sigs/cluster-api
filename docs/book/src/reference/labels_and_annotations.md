| cluster.x-k8s.io/skip-remediation                                | It is used to mark the machines that should not be considered for remediation by MachineHealthCheck reconciler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| cluster.x-k8s.io/managed-by                                      | It can be applied to InfraCluster resources to signify that some external system is managing the cluster infrastructure. Provider InfraCluster controllers will ignore resources with this annotation. An external controller must fulfill the contract of the InfraCluster resource. External infrastructure providers should ensure that the annotation, once set, cannot be removed.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| cluster.x-k8s.io/replicas-managed-by                             | It can be applied to MachinePool resources to signify that some external system is managing infrastructure scaling for that pool. See [the MachinePool documentation](../developer/architecture/controllers/machine-pool.md#externally-managed-autoscaler) for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/defer-upgrade                          | It can be used to defer the Kubernetes upgrade of a single MachineDeployment topology. If the annotation is set on a MachineDeployment topology in Cluster.spec.topology.workers, the Kubernetes upgrade for this MachineDeployment topology is deferred. It doesn't affect other MachineDeployment topologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/dry-run                                | It is an annotation that gets set on objects by the topology controller only during a server side dry run apply operation. It is used for validating update webhooks for objects which get updated by template rotation (e.g. InfrastructureMachineTemplate). When the annotation is set and the admission request is a dry run, the webhook should deny validation due to immutability. By that the request will succeed (without any changes to the actual object because it is a dry run) and the topology controller will receive the resulting object. |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/hold-upgrade-sequence                  | It can be used to hold the entire MachineDeployment upgrade sequence. If the annotation is set on a MachineDeployment topology in Cluster.spec.topology.workers, the Kubernetes upgrade for this MachineDeployment topology and all subsequent ones is deferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| machine.cluster.x-k8s.io/certificates-expiry                     | It captures the expiry date of the machine certificates in RFC3339 format. It is used to trigger rollout of control plane machines before certificates expire. It can be set on BootstrapConfig and Machine objects. The value set on Machine object takes precedence. The annotation is only used by control plane machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| machinedeployment.clusters.x-k8s.io/desired-replicas             | It is the desired replicas for a machine deployment recorded as an annotation in its machine sets. Helps in separating scaling events from the rollout process and for determining if the new machine set for a deployment is really saturated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/kubeadm-cluster-configuration      | It is a machine annotation that stores the json-marshalled string of KCP ClusterConfiguration. This annotation is used to detect any changes in ClusterConfiguration and trigger machine rollout in KCP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/remediation-in-progress            | It is a KCP annotation that tracks that the system is in between having deleted an unhealthy machine and recreating its replacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/remediation-for                    | It is a machine annotation that links a new machine to the unhealthy machine it is replacing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
