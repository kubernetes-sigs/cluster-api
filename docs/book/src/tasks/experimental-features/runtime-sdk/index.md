# Experimental Feature: Runtime SDK (alpha)

The Runtime SDK feature provides an extensibility mechanism that allows systems, products, and services built on top of Cluster API to hook into a workload clusterâ€™s lifecycle.

<aside class="note warning">

All currently implemented hooks require to also enable the [ClusterClass](../cluster-class/index.md) feature.
Please note that hooks are only invoked for Clusters created using ClusterClass.
