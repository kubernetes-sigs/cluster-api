# Troubleshooting

## Node bootstrap failures when using CABPK with cloud-init

Failures during Node bootstrapping can have a lot of different causes. For example, Cluster API resources might be 
misconfigured or there might be problems with the network. The following steps describe how bootstrap failures can 
be troubleshooted systematically.

1. Access the Node via ssh.
1. Take a look at cloud-init logs via `less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log` or `journalctl -u cloud-init --since "1 day ago"`.
   (Note: cloud-init persists logs of the commands it executes (like kubeadm) only after they have returned.)
1. It might also be helpful to take a look at `journalctl --since "1 day ago"`.
1. If you see that kubeadm times out waiting for the static Pods to come up, take a look at:
   1. containerd: `crictl ps -a`, `crictl logs`, `journalctl -u containerd`
   1. Kubelet: `journalctl -u kubelet --since "1 day ago"`
      (Note: it might be helpful to increase the Kubelet log level by e.g. setting `--v=8` via 
      `systemctl edit --full kubelet && systemctl restart kubelet`)
1. If Node bootstrapping consistently fails and the kubeadm logs are not verbose enough, the `kubeadm` verbosity 
   can be increased via `KubeadmConfigSpec.Verbosity`.

## Labeling nodes with reserved labels such as `node-role.kubernetes.io` fails with kubeadm error during bootstrap

Self-assigning Node labels such as `node-role.kubernetes.io` using the kubelet `--node-labels` flag
(see `kubeletExtraArgs` in the [CABPK examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/bootstrap/kubeadm))
is not possible due to a security measure imposed by the
[`NodeRestriction` admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction)
that kubeadm enables by default.

Assigning such labels to Nodes must be done after the bootstrap process has completed:

```
kubectl label nodes <name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=""
```

For convenience, here is an example one-liner to do this post installation

```
# Kubernetes 1.19 (kubeadm 1.19 sets only the node-role.kubernetes.io/master label)
kubectl get nodes --no-headers -l '!node-role.kubernetes.io/master' -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}' | xargs -I{} kubectl label node {} node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=''
# Kubernetes >= 1.20 (kubeadm >= 1.20 sets the node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane label) 
kubectl get nodes --no-headers -l '!node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane' -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}' | xargs -I{} kubectl label node {} node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=''
```                  

## Cluster API with Docker

When provisioning workload clusters using Cluster API with the Docker infrastructure provider,
provisioning might be stuck: 
 
1. if there are stopped containers on your machine from previous runs. Clean unused containers with [docker rm -f ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/). 

2. if the docker space on your disk is being exhausted 
    * Run [docker system df](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_df/) to inspect the disk space consumed by Docker resources.
    * Run [docker system prune --volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) to prune dangling images, containers, volumes and networks.


## Cluster API with Docker Desktop - "too many open files"

When using Cluster API and the Docker infrastructure provider on MacOS with Docker Desktop an error of "too many open files" has been observed.

One solution to this issue is to increase the maximum inotify file watch settings in the Docker Desktop VM.

To do so:

1) Enter the Docker Desktop VM
```
nc -U ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/debug-shell.sock
```
2) Increase the inotify limits using sysctl
```
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192
```
3) Exit the Docker Desktop VM
```
exit
```

Note: This error was observed in Docker 4.3. An alternative solution is to stick with an older version of Docker Desktop while this issue is being resolved. [An issue is currently open on the Docker Desktop repository.](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6071)
