                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                  Independent of this configuration the MachineHealthCheck controller will always

                  Machines with deleted Nodes as unhealthy.

                  Furthermore, if checks.nodeStartupTimeoutSeconds is not set it
                  is defaulted to 10 minutes and evaluated accordingly.
