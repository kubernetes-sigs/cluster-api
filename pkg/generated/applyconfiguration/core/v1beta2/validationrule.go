// ValidationRuleApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the ValidationRule type for use
// with apply.
//
// ValidationRule describes a validation rule written in the CEL expression language.
type ValidationRuleApplyConfiguration struct {
	// rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL.
	// ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
	// The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema.
	// The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value.
	// If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable
	// via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`.
	// If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map
	// are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map
	// are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`.
	// If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and
	// functions.
	// If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value.
	// Examples:
	// - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"}
	// - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"}
	// - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"}
	//
	// Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL
	// expressions. This includes:
	// - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields.
	// - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as:
	// - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
	// - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type"
	// - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type"
	//
	// Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible.
	// Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression:
	// - '__' escapes to '__underscores__'
	// - '.' escapes to '__dot__'
	// - '-' escapes to '__dash__'
	// - '/' escapes to '__slash__'
	// - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
	// "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
	// "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
	// Examples:
	// - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.__namespace__ > 0"}
	// - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x__dash__prop > 0"}
	// - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule": "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
	//
	// If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a
	// `transition rule`.
	//
	// By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`.
	//
	// Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are
	// skipped if an old value could not be found.
	Rule *string `json:"rule,omitempty"`
	// message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
	// line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
	// If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
	// e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"
	Message *string `json:"message,omitempty"`
	// messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
	// Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
	// If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
	// fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
	// as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
	// that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
	// messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
	// Example:
	// "x must be less than max ("+string(self.max)+")"
	MessageExpression *string `json:"messageExpression,omitempty"`
	// reason provides a machine-readable validation failure reason that is returned to the caller when a request fails this validation rule.
	// The currently supported reasons are: "FieldValueInvalid", "FieldValueForbidden", "FieldValueRequired", "FieldValueDuplicate".
	// If not set, default to use "FieldValueInvalid".
	// All future added reasons must be accepted by clients when reading this value and unknown reasons should be treated as FieldValueInvalid.
	Reason *corev1beta2.FieldValueErrorReason `json:"reason,omitempty"`
	// fieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails.
	// It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing field.
	// e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`
	// If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList`
	// It does not support list numeric index.
	// It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.
	// Numeric index of array is not supported.
	// For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name.
	// e.g. for attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testList['foo.34$']`
	FieldPath *string `json:"fieldPath,omitempty"`
