It will help any validation webhook to take decision based on it.  | Cluster API | Any Cluster API resource |
| clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/skip-crd-name-preflight-check        | Can be placed on provider CRDs, so that clusterctl doesn't emit an error if the CRD doesn't comply with Cluster APIs naming scheme. Only CRDs that are referenced by core Cluster API CRDs have to comply with the naming scheme.      | Providers | CRDs |
| controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/kubeadm-cluster-configuration      | It is a machine annotation that stores the json-marshalled string of KCP ClusterConfiguration. This annotation is used to detect any changes in ClusterConfiguration and trigger machine rollout in KCP.    | Cluster API | Machines |

| machinedeployment.clusters.x-k8s.io/desired-replicas             | It is the desired replicas for a machine deployment recorded as an annotation in its machine sets. Helps in separating scaling events from the rollout process and for determining if the new machine set for a deployment is really saturated.   |    Cluster API | MachineSets |
| machinedeployment.clusters.x-k8s.io/max-replicas                 | It is the maximum replicas a deployment can have at a given point, which is machinedeployment.spec.replicas + maxSurge.

| machineset.cluster.x-k8s.io/skip-preflight-checks                | It can be applied on MachineDeployment and MachineSet resources to specify a comma-separated list of preflight checks that should be skipped during MachineSet reconciliation. Supported preflight checks are: All, KubeadmVersionSkew, KubernetesVersionSkew, ControlPlaneIsStable.   | User | MachineDeployment and MachineSet resources |
| pre-drain.delete.hook.machine.cluster.x-k8s.io                   | It specifies the prefix we search each annotation for during the pre-drain.delete lifecycle hook to pause reconciliation of deletion. These hooks will prevent removal of draining the associated node until all are removed.   | User | Machines |
| pre-terminate.delete.hook.machine.cluster.x-k8s.io               | It specifies the prefix we search each annotation for during the pre-terminate.delete lifecycle hook to pause reconciliation of deletion. These hooks will prevent removal of an instance from an infrastructure provider until all are removed.   | User | Machines |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/defer-upgrade                          | It can be used to defer the Kubernetes upgrade of a single MachineDeployment topology. If the annotation is set on a MachineDeployment topology in Cluster.spec.topology.workers, the Kubernetes upgrade for this MachineDeployment topology is deferred. It doesn't affect other MachineDeployment topologies.                                                                                               | Cluster API |	MachineDeployments in Cluster.topology |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/dry-run	                               | It is an annotation that gets set on objects by the topology controller only during a server side dry run apply operation. It is used for validating update webhooks for objects which get updated by template rotation (e.g. InfrastructureMachineTemplate). When the annotation is set and the admission request is a dry run, the webhook should deny validation due to immutability. By that the request will succeed (without any changes to the actual object because it is a dry run) and the topology controller will receive the resulting object. |	Cluster API	| Template rotation objects |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/hold-upgrade-sequence	               | It can be used to hold the entire MachineDeployment upgrade sequence. If the annotation is set on a MachineDeployment topology in Cluster.spec.topology.workers, the Kubernetes upgrade for this MachineDeployment topology and all subsequent ones is deferred.	| Cluster API	| MachineDeployments in Cluster.topology |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/upgrade-concurrency	                   | It can be used to configure the maximum concurrency while upgrading MachineDeployments of a classy Cluster. It is set as a top level annotation on the Cluster object. The value should be >= 1. If unspecified the upgrade concurrency will default to 1. |	Cluster API | Cluster |
| unsafe.topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/disable-update-class-name-check | It can be used to disable the webhook check on update that disallows a pre-existing Cluster to be populated with Topology information and Class. | User     |   Cluster      |
| unsafe.topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/disable-update-version-check    | It can be used to disable the webhook checks on update that disallows updating the .topology.spec.version on certain conditions. | User | Cluster |
