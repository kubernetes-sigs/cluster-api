                          providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
                          This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
                          This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver

                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.
