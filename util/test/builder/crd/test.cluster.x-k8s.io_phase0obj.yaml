              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
                        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
