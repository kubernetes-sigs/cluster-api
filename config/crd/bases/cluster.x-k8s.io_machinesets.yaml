                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different

                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason

                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                  controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the

                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.

                  In the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the
                  replicas, both FailureReason and FailureMessage will be set. FailureReason
                  will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine
                  interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose
                  string suitable for logging and human consumption.

                  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                  controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
                  controller's output.
