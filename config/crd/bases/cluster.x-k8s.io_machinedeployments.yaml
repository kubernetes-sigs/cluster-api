                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api.
                          Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api
                          as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines
                          to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                          get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                          a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field
                          is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider
                          view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                          from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to
                          find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by
                          higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing
                          with cluster-api as generic provider.
