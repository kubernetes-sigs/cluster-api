                                  can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.

                                  e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                                  assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                                  control plane instances.
                                  e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                                  NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                                  controlPlaneEndpoint sets a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane; it
                                  can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.
                                  In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort
                                  are used; in case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is specified but without a TCP port,
                                  the BindPort is used.
                                  Possible usages are:
                                  e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                                  assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                                  control plane instances.
                                  e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                                  NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              This will add about 40KB to userdata
