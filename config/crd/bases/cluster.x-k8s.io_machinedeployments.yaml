                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.

                          starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled

                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different

                          unique on the server.

                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                      remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                      and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.

                        description: |-
                          maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                          Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                          older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                          Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                          prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                          MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                          Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                          the desired replicas.

                          If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                          under the active MachineSet's management.

                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                          starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled

                          This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
                          This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

                  Total number of unavailable machines targeted by this deployment.
                  This is the total number of machines that are still required for
                  the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either
                  be machines that are running but not yet available or machines
                  that still have not been created.

                  Deprecated: This field is deprecated and is going to be removed in the next apiVersion. Please see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20240916-improve-status-in-CAPI-resources.md for more details.
