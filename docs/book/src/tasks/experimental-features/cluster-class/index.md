# Experimental Feature: ClusterClass (alpha)

The ClusterClass feature introduces a new way to create clusters which reduces boilerplate and enables flexible and powerful customization of clusters.
ClusterClass is a powerful abstraction implemented on top of existing interfaces and offers a set of tools and operations to streamline cluster lifecycle management while maintaining the same underlying API.

<aside class="note warning">

In order to use the ClusterClass (alpha) experimental feature the Kubernetes Version for the management cluster must be >= 1.22.0.

        Please note that the experience for creating a Cluster using ClusterClass is very similar to the one for creating a standalone Cluster. Infrastructure providers supporting ClusterClass provide Cluster templates leveraging this feature (e.g the Docker infrastructure provider has a development-topology template).
