# Implementing Topology Mutation Hook Runtime Extensions

<aside class="note warning">

<h1>Caution</h1>

Please note Runtime SDK is an advanced feature. If implemented incorrectly, a failing Runtime Extension can severely impact the Cluster API runtime.

</aside>

## Introduction

Three different hooks are called as part of Topology Mutation - two in the Cluster topology reconciler and one in the ClusterClass reconciler.

**Cluster topology reconciliation**
* **GeneratePatches**: GeneratePatches is responsible for generating patches for the entire Cluster topology.
* **ValidateTopology**: ValidateTopology is called after all patches have been applied and thus allow to validate 
  the resulting objects.

**ClusterClass reconciliation**
* **DiscoverVariables**: DiscoverVariables is responsible for providing variable definitions for a specific external patch.

Please see the corresponding [CAEP](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220330-topology-mutation-hook.md)
for additional background information.

## Inline vs. external patches

Inline patches have the following advantages:
* Inline patches are easier when getting started with ClusterClass as they are built into
  the Cluster API core controller, no external component have to be developed and managed. 

External patches have the following advantages:
* External patches can be individually written, unit tested and released/versioned.
* External patches can leverage the full feature set of a programming language and 
  are thus not limited to the capabilities of JSON patches and Go templating.
* External patches can use external data (e.g. from cloud APIs) during patch generation.
* External patches can be easily reused across ClusterClasses.

## External variable definitions
The DiscoverVariables hook can be used to supply variable definitions for use in external patches. These variable definitions are added to
the status of any applicable ClusterClasses. Clusters using the ClusterClass can then set values for those variables.

### External variable discovery in the ClusterClass
External variable definitions are discovered by calling the DiscoverVariables runtime hook. This hook is called from the ClusterClass reconciler.
Once discovered the variable definitions are validated and stored in ClusterClass status.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
# metadata
spec:
    # Inline variable definitions
    variables:
    # This variable is unique and can be accessed globally.
    - name: no-proxy
      required: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: string
          default: "internal.com"
          example: "internal.com"
          description: "comma-separated list of machine or domain names excluded from using the proxy."
    # This variable is also defined by an external DiscoverVariables hook.
    - name: http-proxy
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: string
          default: "proxy.example.com"
          example: "proxy.example.com"
          description: "proxy for http calls."
    # External patch definitions.
    patches:
    - name: lbImageRepository
      external:
          generateExtension: generate-patches.k8s-upgrade-with-runtimesdk
          validateExtension: validate-topology.k8s-upgrade-with-runtimesdk
          ## Call variable discovery for this patch.
          discoverVariablesExtension: discover-variables.k8s-upgrade-with-runtimesdk
status:
    # observedGeneration is used to check that the current version of the ClusterClass is the same as that when the Status was previously written.
    # if metadata.generation isn't the same as observedGeneration Cluster using the ClusterClass should not reconcile.
    observedGeneration: xx
    # variables contains a list of all variable definitions, both inline and from external patches, that belong to the ClusterClass.
    variables:
      - name: no-proxy
        definitions:
          - from: inline
            required: true
            schema:
              openAPIV3Schema:
                type: string
                default: "internal.com"
                example: "internal.com"
                description: "comma-separated list of machine or domain names excluded from using the proxy."
      - name: http-proxy
        # definitionsConflict is true if there are non-equal definitions for a variable.
        # Note: This conflict has to be resolved, until then corresponding Clusters are not reconciled.
        definitionsConflict: true
        definitions:
          - from: inline
            schema:
              openAPIV3Schema:
                type: string
                default: "proxy.example.com"
                example: "proxy.example.com"
                description: "proxy for http calls."
          - from: lbImageRepository
            schema:
              openAPIV3Schema:
                type: string
                default: "different.example.com"
                example: "different.example.com"
                description: "proxy for http calls."
```

### Variable definition conflicts
Variable definitions can be inline in the ClusterClass or from any number of external DiscoverVariables hooks. The source 
of a variable definition is recorded in the `from` field in ClusterClass `.status.variables`.
Variables that are defined by an external DiscoverVariables hook will have the name of the patch they are associated with as the value of `from`.
Variables that are defined in the ClusterClass `.spec.variables` will have `inline` as the value of `from`.
Note: `inline` is a reserved name for patches. It cannot be used as the name of an external patch to avoid conflicts.

If all variables that share a name have equivalent schemas the variable definitions are not in conflict. The CAPI components will
consider variable definitions to be equivalent when they share a name and their schema is exactly equal. If variables are in conflict
the `VariablesReconciled` will be set to false and the conflict has to be resolved. While there are variable conflicts, corresponding
Clusters will **not be reconciled**.

Note: We enforce that variable conflicts have to be resolved by ClusterClass authors, so that defining Cluster topology is as simply as possible for end users.

### Setting values for variables in the Cluster
Variables that are defined with external variable definitions can be set like regular variables in Cluster `.spec.topology.variables`.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
#metadata 
spec:
    topology:
      variables:
        - name: no-proxy
          value: "internal.domain.com"
        - name: http-proxy
          value: http://proxy.example2.com:1234
```

## Using one or multiple external patch extensions

Some considerations:
* In general a single external patch extension is simpler than many, as only one extension 
  then has to be built, deployed and managed.
* A single extension also requires less HTTP round-trips between the CAPI controller and the extension(s).
* With a single extension it is still possible to implement multiple logical features using different variables.
* When implementing multiple logical features in one extension it's recommended that they can be conditionally
  enabled/disabled via variables (either via certain values or by their existence).
* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) might make it not feasible in large organizations 
  to use a single extension. In those cases it's important that boundaries between extensions are clearly defined.

## Guidelines

For general Runtime Extension developer guidelines please refer to the guidelines in [Implementing Runtime Extensions](implement-extensions.md#guidelines).
This section outlines considerations specific to Topology Mutation hooks.

### Patch extension guidelines
* **Input validation**: An External Patch Extension must always validate its input, i.e. it must validate that
  all variables exist, have the right type and it must validate the kind and apiVersion of the templates which
  should be patched.
* **Timeouts**: As External Patch Extensions are called during each Cluster topology reconciliation, they must
  respond as fast as possible (&lt;=200ms) to avoid delaying individual reconciles and congestion.
* **Availability**: An External Patch Extension must be always available, otherwise Cluster topologies wonâ€™t be
  reconciled anymore.
* **Side Effects**: An External Patch Extension must not make out-of-band changes. If necessary external data can
  be retrieved, but be aware of performance impact.
* **Deterministic results**: For a given request (a set of templates and variables) an External Patch Extension must
  always return the same response (a set of patches). Otherwise the Cluster topology will never reach a stable state.
* **Idempotence**: An External Patch Extension must only return patches if changes to the templates are required,
  i.e. unnecessary patches when the template is already in the desired state must be avoided.
* **Avoid Dependencies**: An External Patch Extension must be independent of other External Patch Extensions. However
  if dependencies cannot be avoided, it is possible to control the order in which patches are executed via the ClusterClass.
* **Error messages**: For a given request (a set of templates and variables) an External Patch Extension must
  always return the same error message. Otherwise the system might become unstable due to controllers being overloaded
  by continuous changes to Kubernetes resources as these messages are reported as conditions. See [error messages](implement-extensions.md#error-messages).

### Variable discovery guidelines
* **Distinctive variable names**: Names should be carefully chosen, and if possible generic names should be avoided. 
Using a generic name could lead to conflicts if the variables defined for this patch are used in combination with other 
patches providing variables with the same name.
* **Avoid breaking changes to variable definitions**: Changing a variable definition can lead to problems on existing 
clusters because reconciliation will stop if variable values do not match the updated definition. When more than one variable 
with the same name is defined, changes to variable definitions can require explicit values for each patch. 
Updates to the variable definition should be carefully evaluated, and very well documented in extension release notes, 
so ClusterClass authors can evaluate impacts of changes before performing an upgrade.

## Definitions

### GeneratePatches

A GeneratePatches call generates patches for the entire Cluster topology. Accordingly the request contains all
templates, the global variables and the template-specific variables. The response contains generated patches.

#### Example request:

* Generating patches for a Cluster topology is done via a single call to allow External Patch Extensions a
  holistic view of the entire Cluster topology. Additionally this allows us to reduce the number of round-trips.
* Each item in the request will contain the template as a raw object. Additionally information about where
  the template is used is provided via `holderReference`.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GeneratePatchesRequest
settings: <Runtime Extension settings>
variables:
- name: <variable-name>
  value: <variable-value>
  ...
items:
- uid: 7091de79-e26c-4af5-8be3-071bc4b102c9
  holderReference:
    apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineDeployment
    namespace: default
    name: cluster-md1-xyz
    fieldPath: spec.template.spec.infrastructureRef
  object:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: AWSMachineTemplate
    spec:
    ...
  variables:
  - name: <variable-name>
    value: <variable-value>
    ...
```

#### Example Response:

* The response contains patches instead of full objects to reduce the payload.
* Templates in the request and patches in the response will be correlated via UIDs.
* Like inline patches, external patches are only allowed to change fields in `spec.template.spec`.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GeneratePatchesResponse
status: Success # or Failure
message: "error message if status == Failure"
items:
- uid: 7091de79-e26c-4af5-8be3-071bc4b102c9
  patchType: JSONPatch
  patch: <JSON-patch>
```

For additional details, you can see the full schema in <button onclick="openSwaggerUI()">Swagger UI</button>.

We are considering to introduce a library to facilitate development of External Patch Extensions. It would provide capabilities like:
* Accessing builtin variables
* Extracting certain templates from a GeneratePatches request (e.g. all bootstrap templates)

If you are interested in contributing to this library please reach out to the maintainer team or
feel free to open an issue describing your idea or use case.

### ValidateTopology

A ValidateTopology call validates the topology after all patches have been applied. The request contains all 
templates of the Cluster topology, the global variables and the template-specific variables. The response
contains the result of the validation.

#### Example Request:

* The request is the same as the GeneratePatches request except it doesn't have `uid` fields. We don't
  need them as we don't have to correlate patches in the response.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidateTopologyRequest
settings: <Runtime Extension settings>
variables:
- name: <variable-name>
  value: <variable-value>
  ...
items:
- holderReference:
    apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineDeployment
    namespace: default
    name: cluster-md1-xyz
    fieldPath: spec.template.spec.infrastructureRef
  object:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: AWSMachineTemplate
    spec:
    ...
  variables:
  - name: <variable-name>
    value: <variable-value>
    ...
```

#### Example Response:

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidateTopologyResponse
status: Success # or Failure
message: "error message if status == Failure"
```

function openSwaggerUI() {
  var schemaURL = new URL("runtime-sdk-openapi.yaml", document.baseURI).href
  window.open("https://editor.swagger.io/?url=" + schemaURL)
}
</script>

### DiscoverVariables

A DiscoverVariables call returns definitions for one or more variables.

#### Example Request:

* The request is a simple call to the Runtime hook.

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoverVariablesRequest
settings: <Runtime Extension settings>
```

#### Example Response:

```yaml
apiVersion: hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoverVariablesResponse
status: Success # or Failure
message: ""
variables:
  - name: etcdImageTag 
    required: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: string
        default: "3.5.3-0" 
        example: "3.5.3-0"
        description: "etcdImageTag sets the tag for the etcd image."

            default: "restricted"
            description: "audit sets the level for the audit PodSecurityConfiguration mode. One of privileged, baseline, restricted."

## Dealing with Cluster API upgrades with apiVersion bumps

There are some special considerations regarding Cluster API upgrades when the upgrade includes a bump
of the apiVersion of infrastructure, bootstrap or control plane provider CRDs.

When calling external patches the Cluster topology controller is always sending the templates in the apiVersion of the references
in the ClusterClass.

While inline patches are always referring to one specific apiVersion, external patch implementations are more flexible. They can
be written in a way that they are able to handle multiple apiVersions of a CRD. This can be done by calculating patches differently
depending on which apiVersion is received by the external patch implementation.

This allows users more flexibility during Cluster API upgrades:

Variant 1: External patch implementation supporting two apiVersions at the same time

1. Update Cluster API
2. Update the external patch implementation to be able to handle custom resources with the old and the new apiVersion
3. Update the references in ClusterClasses to use the new apiVersion

**Note** In this variant it doesn't matter if Cluster API or the external patch implementation is updated first.

Variant 2: Deploy an additional instance of the external patch implementation which can handle the new apiVersion

1. Upgrade Cluster API
2. Deploy the new external patch implementation which is able to handle the new apiVersion
3. Update ClusterClasses to use the new apiVersion and the new external patch implementation
4. Remove the old external patch implementation as it's not used anymore

**Note** In this variant it doesn't matter if Cluster API is updated or the new external patch implementation is deployed first.
