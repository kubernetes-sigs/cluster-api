                  This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                  with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

                  This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                  with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                  be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                  Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                  for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                  Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                  they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                  NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                  NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                  readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                  readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.

                      If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.
