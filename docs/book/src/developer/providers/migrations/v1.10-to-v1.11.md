# Cluster API v1.10 compared to v1.11

This document provides an overview over relevant changes between Cluster API v1.10 and v1.11 for
maintainers of providers and consumers of our Go API.

Any feedback or contributions to improve following documentation is welcome!

We also recommend to (re)read the [Improving status in CAPI resources](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/4a2e16a3d71d99a923b1f7f3a3efe03c299665fb/docs/proposals/20240916-improve-status-in-CAPI-resources.md)
proposal because most of the changes described below are a consequence of the work for implementing this proposal.

## Go version

- The minimal Go version required to build Cluster API is v1.24.x
- The Go version used by Cluster API is v1.24.x

## Dependencies

- The Controller Runtime version used by Cluster API is v0.21.x
- The version of the Kubernetes libraries used by Cluster API is v1.33.x

## API Changes

- APIs have been moved to the top-level `api` folder (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/12262).
  If you keep using `v1alpha` / `v1beta1` APIs, imports have to be adjusted accordingly: 
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/bootstrap/kubeadm/api/v1beta1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/bootstrap/kubeadm/v1beta1` (apiGroup: `bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controlplane/kubeadm/api/v1beta1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/controlplane/kubeadm/v1beta1` (apiGroup: `controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/v1beta1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/core/v1beta1` (apiGroup: `cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/exp/api/v1beta1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/core/v1beta1` (apiGroup: `cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/exp/ipam/api/v1alpha1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/ipam/v1alpha1` (apiGroup: `ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/exp/ipam/api/v1beta1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/ipam/v1beta1` (apiGroup: `ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/exp/runtime/api/v1alpha1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/runtime/v1alpha1` (apiGroup: `runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/exp/runtime/hooks/api/v1alpha1` => `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/runtime/hooks/v1alpha1` (apiGroup: `hooks.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
- v1beta1 API version is now deprecated and it will be removed tentatively in August 2026
- v1beta2 API version has been introduced; see following paragraphs for more details. The APIs have 
  been added in the following packages:
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/bootstrap/kubeadm/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/controlplane/kubeadm/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/addons/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `addons.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/core/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/ipam/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
  - `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/runtime/v1beta2` (apiGroup: `runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io`)
- If you are using the `runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io` API group, please be aware that
  - `ExtensionConfig` v1alpha1 has been deprecated, and it will be removed in a following release.
  - `ExtensionConfig` v1beta2 has been created (thus aligning with other Cluster API resources)
- `controllers/remote.ClusterCacheTracker` and corresponding types have been removed
- The unused `ClusterStatus` struct in the kubeadm bootstrap apiGroup has been removed

### All CRDs

- The transition to the new K8s aligned conditions using `metav1.Conditions` types and the new condition semantic
  has been completed for all Kinds:
  - `status.conditions` has been replaced with `status.v1beta2.conditions` based on metav1 condition types
  - the old `status.conditions` based on custom cluster API condition types will continue to exist temporarily 
    under `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions` for the sake of down conversions and to provide a temporary option
    for users willing to continue using old conditions.
- Please pay attention to field removals, e.g. if you are using GitOps tools, either migrate to v1beta2 or make sure
  to stop setting the removed fields. The removed fields won't be preserved even if setting them via v1beta1
  (as they don't exist in v1beta2).
  - For example, we removed the `clusterName` field from `KubeadmControlPlane.spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration`

- The following `spec.kubeadmConfigSpec` fields have been removed because they are not necessary (Cluster API automatically applies the right gvk when generating kubeadm config files):
  - `clusterConfiguration.apiVersion`, `clusterConfiguration.kind`
  - `initConfiguration.apiVersion`, `initConfiguration.kind`
  - `joinConfiguration.apiVersion`, `joinConfiguration.kind`
- The following `spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration` fields have been removed because they are duplicates
  to fields that already exist in the Cluster object:
  - `networking.serviceSubnet` (can still be set via `Cluster.spec.clusterNetwork.services.cidrBlocks`)
  - `networking.podSubnet` (can still be set via `Cluster.spec.clusterNetwork.pods.cidrBlocks`)
  - `networking.dnsDomain` (can still be set via `Cluster.spec.clusterNetwork.serviceDomain`)
  - `kubernetesVersion` (can still be set via `KubeadmControlPlane.spec.version`)
  - `controlPlaneEndpoint` (can still be set via `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint`)
  - `clusterName` (can still be set via `Cluster.metadata.name`)
  Note: The ClusterConfiguration fields could previously be used to overwrite the fields from Cluster, now we only use the fields from Cluster.
- All fields of type Duration in `spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.initConfiguration.bootstrapTokens[]` have
  been renamed by adding the `Seconds` suffix and their type was changed to int32, thus aligning to K8s guidelines.
  - `.ttl` => `.ttlSeconds`
- All fields of type Duration in `spec.machineTemplate` have
  been renamed by adding the `Seconds` suffix and their type was changed to int32, thus aligning to K8s guidelines.
  - `nodeDrainTimeout` => `nodeDrainTimeoutSeconds`
  - `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout` => `nodeVolumeDetachTimeoutSeconds`
  - `nodeDeletionTimeout` => `nodeDeletionTimeoutSeconds`
- All fields of type Duration in `spec.remediationStrategy` have
  been renamed by adding the `Seconds` suffix and their type was changed to int32, thus aligning to K8s guidelines.
  - `retryPeriod` => `retryPeriodSeconds`
  - `minHealthyPeriod` => `minHealthyPeriodSeconds`
- Replica counters fields are now consistent with replica counters from other resources.
  - `status.replicas` was made a pointer and omitempty was added
  - `status.readyReplicas` has now a new semantic based on machine's `Ready` condition
  - `status.availableReplicas` has now a new semantic based on machine's `Available` condition
  - `status.upToDateReplicas` has now a new semantic (and name) based on machine's `UpToDate` condition
  - Temporarily, old replica counters will still be available under the `status.deprecated.v1beta1` struct
- Information about the initial provisioning process is now surfacing under the new `status.initialization` field.
  - `status.ready` has been dropped
  - `status.initialized` has been replaced by `status.initialization.controlPlaneInitialized`
- Support for terminal errors has been dropped.
  - `status.failureReason` and `status.failureMessage` will continue to exist temporarily under `status.deprecated.v1beta1`.
  
### KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate

KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate `spec.template.spec` has been aligned to changes in the [KubeadmControlPlane](#kubeadmcontrolplane) `spec` struct.

### ClusterResourceSetBinding

- Remove deprecated `ClusterResourceSetBinding.DeleteBinding` func

### IPAddress
- The type of the `spec.claimRef` field has been changed from `corev1.LocalObjectReference` to `IPAddressClaimReference`.
- The type of the `spec.poolRef` field has been changed from `corev1.TypedLocalObjectReference` to `IPPoolReference`.
  - The type of the `spec.poolRef.apiGroup` field has been changed from `*string` to `string`.
  
### IPAddressClaim
- The type of the `spec.poolRef` field has been changed from `corev1.TypedLocalObjectReference` to `IPPoolReference`.
  - The type of the `spec.poolRef.apiGroup` field has been changed from `*string` to `string`.
- The type of the `status.addressRef` field has been changed from `corev1.LocalObjectReference` to `IPAddressReference`.

## Cluster API Contract changes

- v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract is now deprecated
  - In order to ease the transition to the new v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract, v1beta2 version 
    will implement temporarily compatibility with the deprecated v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract   
    - Compatibility is only intended to ease the transition for providers, and it has some limitations; please
      read details in following paragraphs.
  - Compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract will be removed tentatively in August 2026 
  - After compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract is removed, providers 
    which are implementing the v1beta1 contract will stop to work (they will work only with older versions of Cluster API).
  
- v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract has been introduced; see following paragraphs for more details

### Contract rules for IPAM provider

TODO

### Contract rules for MachinePool

TODO

### clusterctl

- **Stricter validation for provider metadata**: clusterctl now enforces validation rules when reading provider metadata files to ensure they are properly formatted and contain required information.
  These changes help surface mis-shaped metadata early and make failures easier to troubleshoot. Providers with invalid metadata.yaml files will need to update them to comply with these validation rules.
  The following validation rules are now enforced:
  - `apiVersion` must be set to `clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3`
  - `kind` must be set to `Metadata`
  - `releaseSeries` must contain at least one entry
- The `--v1beta2` flag in clusterctl describe now defaults to `true`; the flag will be removed as soon as v1beta1 API is removed.

## Deprecations

- v1beta1 API version is deprecated and it will be removed tentatively in August 2026 
  - All the fields under `status.deprecated.v1beta1` in the new v1beta2 API are deprecated and whey will be removed. This includes:
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions` based on custom cluster API condition types
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.failureReason`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.failureMessage`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.readyReplicas` with old semantic for `MachineDeployments`, `MachineSet` and `KubeadmControlPlane`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.availableReplicas` with old semantic for `MachineDeployments`, `MachineSet`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.unavailableReplicas` with old semantic for `MachineDeployments`, `KubeadmControlPlane`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.updatedReplicas` with old semantic (and name) for `MachineDeployments`, `KubeadmControlPlane`
    - `status.deprecated.v1beta1.fullyLabeledReplicas` for `MachineSet`
- v1beta1 conditions utils are now deprecated, and will removed as soon as v1beta1 API will be removed
- v1beta1 support in the patch helper is now deprecated, and will removed as soon as v1beta1 API will be removed

- As a consequence of dropping support for terminal errors from all Kinds, the const values for
  `Failed` phase has been deprecated in the following enum types (controllers are not setting this value anymore):
  - `ClusterPhase`, used in `cluster.status.phase`
  - `MachineDeploymentPhase`, used in `machineDeployment.status.phase`
  - `MachinePoolPhase`, used in `machinePool.status.phase`
  - `MachinePhase`, used in `machine.status.phase`

## clusterctl changes

* The `clusterctl alpha rollout undo` command has been removed as the corresponding revision history feature has been removed from MachineDeployment
  
## Removals scheduled for future releases

As documented in [Suggested changes for providers](#suggested-changes-for-providers), it is highly recommended to start planning for future removals:

- v1beta1 API version will be removed tentatively in August 2026
- Starting from the CAPI release when v1beta1 removal will happen (tentative Aug 2026), the Cluster API project
  will remove the Cluster API condition type, the `util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1` package, 
  the `util/deprecated/v1beta1` package, the code handling old conditions in `util/patch.Helper`
  and everything related to the custom Cluster API custom condition type.
- Compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract will be removed tentatively in August 2026

## Suggested changes for providers

- We highly recommend providers to start using Cluster API v1beta2 types when bumping to CAPI v1.11. 
  This requires changing following import:

  ```go
  import (
      ...
      clusterv1 "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/core/v1beta1"
  )
  ```
  
  into:
  
  ```go
  import (
      ...
      clusterv1 "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/api/core/v1beta2"
  )
  ```

  Please refer to [API Changes](#api-changes) for more details about the changes introduced by this release.

  Note: it is technically possible for providers to keep using v1beta1 types from CAPI v1.11, but this is 
  not recommended because it will lead to additional conversion calls.

  Additionally, in v1.11 all the CAPI utils like e.g. `IsControlPlaneMachine` are now using v1beta2 API types. 
  This might lead to additional work for providers to keep using v1beta1 types from CAPI v1.11 (you have to fork
  all utils the provider is using from an older CAPI release or replace them with something else).
  
  Last but not least, please be aware that given the issues above, this approach was not tested during the implementation, 
  and we don't know if there are road blockers.

- If providers are using Conditions from Cluster API resources, e.g. by looking at the ControlPlaneInitialized condition
  on the Cluster object, we highly recommend providers to use new conditions instead of old ones.
  Utils for working with new conditions ara available in the `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions` package.
  - To keep using old conditions from the Cluster object, temporarily present under `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions`
    it is required to use utils from the `util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1` package.
    Please note that `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions` will be removed tentatively in August 2026.

- We highly recommend providers to start planning the move to the new v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract
  for their own resources, e.g. in the AWSCluster or the AWSMachine resource; the transition MUST be completed before
  compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract will be removed tentatively in August 2026

- Depending on which Cluster API contract version you are choosing to implement in the provider's own CRDs, please refer to:
  * [How to bump to CAPI V1.11 but keep implementing the deprecated v1beta1 contract](#how-to-bump-to-capi-v111-but-keep-implementing-the-deprecated-v1beta1-contract)
  * [How to implement the new v1beta2 contract](#how-to-implement-the-new-v1beta2-contract)
  
- We highly recommend providers to define their future strategy for condition management for their own resources, e.g.
  in the AWSCluster or the AWSMachine resource; also in this case the transition to the new condition management
  strategy MUST be completed before compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract 
  will be removed tentatively in August 2026.
  Available options are:
  - Migrate to `metav1.Conditions` like Cluster API (recommended)
  - Replace Cluster API's v1beta1 Conditions with a custom condition implementation that is compliant with
    what is required by the v1beta2 Cluster API contract.  
    - Starting from the CAPI release when v1beta1 removal will happen (tentative August 2026), the Cluster API project
      will remove the Cluster API condition type, the `util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1` package, the `util/deprecated/v1beta1` package,
      the code handling old conditions in `util/patch.Helper` and everything related to the custom Cluster API custom condition type.
  
- Depending on which option you are choosing for condition management in the provider's own CRDs, please refer to:
  * [How to bump to CAPI V1.11 but keep using deprecated v1beta1 conditions](#how-to-bump-to-capi-v111-but-keep-using-deprecated-v1beta1-conditions)
  * [How to start using metav1.conditions](#how-to-start-using-metav1conditions)

- References on Cluster, KubeadmControlPlane, MachineDeployment, MachinePool, MachineSet and Machine are now using the 
  `ContractVersionedObjectReference` type instead of `corev1.ObjectReference`. These references can now be resolved with
  `external.GetObjectFromContractVersionedRef` instead of `external.Get`:

  ```go
  external.GetObjectFromContractVersionedRef(ctx, r.Client, cluster.Spec.InfrastructureRef, cluster.Namespace)
  ```

- core Cluster API added the new CRD migrator component in the v1.9 release. For more details, see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/11894
  - CRD migration in clusterctl has been deprecated and will be removed in CAPI v1.13, so it's recommended to
    adopt the CRD migrator in providers instead.
  - Please see the examples in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/11889, the following high-level steps are required:
    - Add the `--skip-crd-migration-phases` command-line flag that allows to skip CRD migration phases
    - Setup the `CRDMigrator` component with the manager.
    - Configure all CRDs owned by your provider, only set `UseCache` for the objects for which your provider already has an informer.
    - Add the following RBAC:
    - resources: `customresourcedefinitions`, verbs: `get;list;watch`
    - resources: `customresourcedefinitions;customresourcedefinitions/status`, resourceNames: `<crd-name>`, verbs: `update;patch`
      - Note: The CRD migrator will add the `crd-migration.cluster.x-k8s.io/observed-generation` annotation on the CRD object,
        please ensure that if these CRD objects are deployed with a tool like kapp / Argo / Flux the annotation is not continuously removed.
    - For all CRs that should be migrated by the `CRDMigrator`: verbs: `get;list;watch;patch;update`
    - For all CRs with `UseStatusForStorageVersionMigration: true` verbs: `update;patch` on their `/status` resource (e.g. `ipaddressclaims/status`)

### How to bump to CAPI V1.11 but keep implementing the deprecated v1beta1 contract

CAPI v1.11 implements the v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract.

However, in order to ease the transition for providers, the v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract _temporarily_
preserves compatibility with the deprecated v1beta1 contract; a few limitations apply, please read 
[Cluster API Contract changes](#cluster-api-contract-changes) for more details.

Provider's implementing the deprecated v1beta1 contract can leverage compatibility support without any change,
but it is crucial for them to start planning for the implementation of the new v1beta2 version of
the Cluster API contract as soon a possible.

The implementation of the new v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract MUST be completed before compatibility
support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract will be removed tentatively in August 2026.

After compatibility support for the v1beta1 version of the Cluster API contract will be removed, providers
which are still implementing the v1beta1 contract will stop to work (they will work only with older versions of Cluster API).

Please see [Cluster API Contract changes](#cluster-api-contract-changes) and [provider contracts](../contracts/overview.md) for more details.

### How to implement the new v1beta2 contract

We highly recommend providers to start planning the move to the new v1beta2 version of the Cluster API contract as soon
as possible.

Implementing the new v1beta2 contract for providers is a two step operation:
1. Implement changes defined for a specific provider type; See [Cluster API Contract changes](#cluster-api-contract-changes) and [provider contracts](../contracts/overview.md) for more details.
  - In most cases, v1beta2 contract introduced changes in the `initialization completed`, `conditions`, `terminal failures` rules;
    Also `replicas` rule is changed for control plane providers.
2. While implementing the changes above, It is also highly recommended to check the implementation of all the other rules
   (documentation for contract rules have been improved in recent releases, worth to take a look!).
3. Change the CRD annotation that document which Cluster API contract is implemented by your Provider. e.g.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
    cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2: <your API version>
  name: <your CRD name>
```

### How to bump to CAPI V1.11 but keep using deprecated v1beta1 conditions

A provider can continue to use deprecated v1beta1 conditions also after bumping to CAPI V1.11, but to do
so it is required to change following imports:

```go
import (
	...
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions"
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch"
)
```

into:

```go
import (
	...
    v1beta1conditions "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/conditions"
    v1beta1patch "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch"
)
```

Important! 
Please pay special attention to use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` import everywhere,
because using `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch` by mistake could in some cases lead to dropping conditions at runtime.

Also, please note that starting from the CAPI release when v1beta1 removal will happen (tentative Aug 2026), the Cluster API project
will remove the Cluster API condition type, the `util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1` package, the `util/deprecated/v1beta1` package,
the code handling old conditions in `util/patch.Helper` and everything related to the custom Cluster API custom condition type.

This means that if a provider wants to keep using deprecated v1beta1 conditions after this date, they have to maintain their
own custom copy of the types and related utils.

Also note that the v1beta2 contract is not going to require a specific condition type, so it will be also possible
to use a custom condition type,

See [Suggested changes for providers](#suggested-changes-for-providers) and [Cluster API Contract changes](#cluster-api-contract-changes)
for more details.

### How to start using metav1.conditions

If providers choose to migrate `metav1.Conditions`, the process described in [Improving status in CAPI resources](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/4a2e16a3d71d99a923b1f7f3a3efe03c299665fb/docs/proposals/20240916-improve-status-in-CAPI-resources.md)
can be used as a reference about how to implement a phased transition.

As a quick summary, transition should go through following phases:

#### Stage 1 

Add `status.v1beta2.conditions` to your API (existing conditions will remain at `status.conditions`)

If you are at this stage, you must use following util packages from CAPI v1.11 (or following releases, see note below):

```go
import (
	...
    v1beta1conditions "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/conditions"
    v1beta2conditions "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/conditions/v1beta2"
    v1beta1patch "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch"
)
```

- the `v1beta1conditions` package alias provides access to utils for managing `clusterv1beta1.Conditions` in `status.conditions`
- the `v1beta2conditions` package alias provides access to utils for managing `metav1.Conditions` in `status.v1beta2.conditions`
- the `v1beta1patch` package alias provides access to utils for patching objects in this phase.

Important!
- Please pay special attention to use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` import everywhere,
  because using `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch` by mistake could in some cases lead to dropping conditions at runtime
  (note: `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch` is the package we assume you are using before stage 1).
- All packages from the import above (all packages below `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1`) are going
  to be removed from CAPI when the v1beta1 removal will happen (tentative Aug 2026).

#### Stage 2

Create a new API version, swap old conditions and new conditions, implement conversions
- Move old conditions from `status.conditions` to `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions`
- Move new conditions from `status.v1beta2.conditions` to `status.conditions`

If you are at this stage, you must use following util packages from CAPI v1.11 (or following releases, see note below):

```go
import (
	...
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions"
    deprecatedv1beta1conditions "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1"
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch"
)
```

- the `conditions` package provides access to utils for managing `metav1.Conditions` in `status.conditions`
- the `deprecatedv1beta1conditions` package alias provides access to utils for managing `clusterv1.Conditions` in `status.deprecated.v1beta1.conditions`
- the `patch` package provides access to utils for patching objects in this phase

Important!
- Please pay special attention to use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch` import everywhere,
  because using `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` by mistake could in some cases lead to dropping conditions at runtime
  (note: `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` is the package you were using in stage 1, it should not be used in stage 2).
- The package `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions/deprecated/v1beta1`" is going to be removed from CAPI when the
  v1beta1 removal will happen (tentative Aug 2026).

#### Stage 3

When removing the old API version, remove `status.deprecated.v1beta1` 

Following util packages from CAPI v1.11 (or following releases) should be still in use:

```go
import (
	...
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/conditions"
    "sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch"
)
```

- the `conditions` package provides access to utils for managing `metav1.Conditions` in `status.conditions`
- the `patch` package provides access to utils for patching objects in this phase

Important!
- Please pay special attention to use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/patch` import everywhere,
  because using `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` by mistake could in some cases lead to dropping conditions at runtime
  (note: `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/deprecated/v1beta1/patch` is the package in stage 1, if should not be used in following stages).

## Annex

### Imports for conditions and patch helper utils

In order to help users to transition away from the CAPI conditions type, CAPI v1.11 supports
different versions of conditions and patch helper utils.

Following table should help to pick the right utils.

| Field to change                                                       | Import for condition util                                                                  | Import for patch helper                                                |
