                  infrastructure is a reference to a provider-specific template that holds
                  the details for provisioning infrastructure specific cluster
                  for the underlying provider.
                  The underlying provider is responsible for the implementation
                  of the template to an infrastructure cluster.

                          If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                          should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                          referencing a part of an object.

                                      e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`

                                      It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.

                                      message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                      line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
                                      If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
                                      e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                    maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                The templating mechanism provides the following arguments:
                                * `.cluster.name`: The name of the cluster object.

                                            e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`
                                            If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList`
                                            It does not support list numeric index.
                                            It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.
                                            Numeric index of array is not supported.
                                            For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name.
                                            e.g. for attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testList['foo.34$']`

                                            message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                            line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
                                            If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
                                            e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
                                            Example:
