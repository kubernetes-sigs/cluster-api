                          maxSurge is the maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
                          desired number of machines.
                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
                          desired machines (ex: 10%).
                          This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                          machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
                          be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
                          at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

                          machines (ex: 10%).
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                          This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                          Defaults to 0.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
                          down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
                          starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
                          down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
                          that the total number of machines available at all times
                          during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different

                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason

                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                              configRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
                              that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
                              allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.Data without
                              the need of a controller.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
