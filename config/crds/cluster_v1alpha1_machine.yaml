                the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required
                by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster
                autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler
                compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which
                could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required
                by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines.
                Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then comparison
                is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level
                entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api
                as generic provider.

                it to    the Node, and finding the appropriate field in Node.Status.NodeInfo    (which
                uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes some of
                the dependency on the structure of the Node,    so that if the structure
                of Node.Status.NodeInfo changes, only    machine controllers need
                to be updated, rather than every client    of the Machines API. 3)
                There is no other simple way to check the control plane    version.
                A client would have to connect directly to the apiserver    running
                on the target node in order to find out its version.'
