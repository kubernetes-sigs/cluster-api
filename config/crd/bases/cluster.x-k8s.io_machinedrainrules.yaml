                      "Drain" means that the Pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will be drained.
                      If behavior is set to "Drain" the order in which Pods are drained can be configured
                      with the order field. When draining Pods of a Node the Pods will be grouped by order
                      and one group after another will be drained (by increasing order). Cluster API will
                      wait until all Pods of a group are terminated / removed from the Node before starting
                      with the next group.
                      "Skip" means that the Pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will be skipped during drain.
