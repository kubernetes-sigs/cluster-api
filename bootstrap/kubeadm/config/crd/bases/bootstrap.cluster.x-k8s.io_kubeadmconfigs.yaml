                      can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.
                      In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort
                      are used; in case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is specified but without a TCP port,

                      Possible usages are:
                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.
                      e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                      NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                  useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                  where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                      In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort

                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.

                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                  useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell
                  script with retries for joins.

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                  where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                  This will add about 40KB to userdata

                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.
                      e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                  where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.
