# Controllers

This section of the book provides an overview about "core" controllers in Cluster API.

<aside class="note warning">

<h1>The code is the source of truth!</h1>

While we put a great effort in ensuring a good documentation for Cluster API, we also recognize that some
part of the documentation are more prone to miss details or become outdated.

Unfortunately, this section is one of those parts, because things in Cluster API change fast and the
complexity of core controllers keeps growing.

Please feel free to open issues or even better send PRs with improvement that can make this documentation 
even more valuable for the readers that will follow you.
