| pre-terminate.delete.hook.machine.cluster.x-k8s.io               | It specifies the prefix we search each annotation for during the pre-terminate.delete lifecycle hook to pause reconciliation of deletion.

| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/defer-upgrade                          | It can be used to defer the Kubernetes upgrade of a single MachineDeployment topology. If the annotation is set on a MachineDeployment topology in Cluster.spec.topology.workers, the Kubernetes upgrade for this MachineDeployment topology is deferred. It doesn't affect other MachineDeployment topologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Cluster API              | 	MachineDeployments in Cluster.topology        |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/dry-run                                | It is an annotation that gets set on objects by the topology controller only during a server side dry run apply operation. It is used for validating update webhooks for objects which get updated by template rotation (e.g. InfrastructureMachineTemplate). When the annotation is set and the admission request is a dry run, the webhook should deny validation due to immutability. By that the request will succeed (without any changes to the actual object because it is a dry run) and the topology controller will receive the resulting object. | Cluster API	             | Template rotation objects                      |
| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/hold-upgrade-sequence                  | It can be used to hold the entire MachineDeployment upgrade sequence.

| topology.cluster.x-k8s.io/upgrade-concurrency                    | It can be used to configure the maximum concurrency while upgrading MachineDeployments of a classy Cluster.
