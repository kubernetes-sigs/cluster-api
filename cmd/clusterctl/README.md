# Clusterctl

## Compatibility notice

The `clusterctl` CLI is developed in lock-step with Cluster API. We strongly recommend using the latest released version for the series you're using. For example, if you're managing clusters with Cluster API v0.3.7, the `clusterctl` version should be >= v0.3.7.

When this package is used as a library, we do not currently provide any compatibility guarantees. We will make reasonable efforts to follow a typical deprecation period prior to removal, but breaking changes can happen when necessary.
