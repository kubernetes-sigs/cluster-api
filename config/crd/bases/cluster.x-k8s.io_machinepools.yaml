                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.

                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.


                          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason

                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                              that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to

                              the need of a controller.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                    ---
                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                    For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .
                  properties:
                    apiVersion:
                      description: API version of the referent.
                      type: string
                    fieldPath:
                      description: |-
                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
