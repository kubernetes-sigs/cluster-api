All artwork in this repo is made available under the Linux Foundation trademark
usage [guidelines](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage/).

This text from those guidelines, and the correct and incorrect usage examples, are
particularly helpful:

> Certain marks of The Linux Foundation have been created to enable you to
> communicate compatibility or interoperability of software or products.
> In addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make an assertion
> of compatibility must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must
> avoid confusion regarding The Linux Foundationâ€™s association with the product.
> The use of the mark cannot imply that The Linux Foundation or its projects are
> sponsoring or endorsing the product.
