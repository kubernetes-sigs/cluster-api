                                      It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                                and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.
                              properties:

                                    maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                    Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
                                    up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total

                                    machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
                                    be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
                                    at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                      fieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails.
                                      It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing field.
                                      e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`
                                      If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList`
                                      It does not support list numeric index.
                                      It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.
                                      Numeric index of array is not supported.
                                      For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name.

                                      If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                    maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                            message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                            line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
                                            If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
                                            Example:
