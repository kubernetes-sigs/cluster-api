# Cluster API v1.3 compared to v1.4

This document provides an overview over relevant changes between Cluster API v1.3 and v1.4 for
maintainers of providers and consumers of our Go API.

## Minimum Go version

- The Go version used by Cluster API is still Go 1.19.x

## Dependencies

**Note**: Only the most relevant dependencies are listed, `k8s.io/` and `ginkgo`/`gomega` dependencies in Cluster API are kept in sync with the versions used by `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime`.

- sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime: v0.13.x => v0.14.x
- sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools: v0.10.x => v0.11.x
- github.com/joelanford/go-apidiff: 0.5.0 => 0.6.0

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

-

### Removals

- `util/conversion.GetCRDWithContract` has been removed.
- `clusterctl backup` has been removed.
- `clusterctl restore` has been removed.
- `api/v1beta1.MachineHealthCheckSuccededCondition` condition type has been removed.
- `controller/external/util.CloneTemplate` and `controllers/external/util.CloneTemplateInput` has been removed.
- The option `--list-images` from `clusterctl init` subcommand has been removed.
- `exp/runtime/server.NewServer` has been removed.
- `--disable-no-echo` option from `clusterctl describe cluster` subcommand has been removed
- `api/v1beta1.ClusterTopologyManagedFieldsAnnotation` field has been removed.
- `api/v1beta1.PopulateDefaultsMachineDeployment` func has been removed.

### API Changes

- `util/conversion.UpdateReferenceAPIContract` dropped the `APIReader` parameter because it's not required anymore as we now only handle CRDs with compliant names.
- `Backup(options BackupOptions) error` in the Client interface has been removed.
- `Restore(options RestoreOptions) error` in the Client interface has been removed.
- `cmd/clusterctl/client.RolloutOptions` has been removed, `RolloutRestartOptions`, `RolloutPauseOptions` , `RolloutResumeOptions`, and `RolloutUndoOptions` have been added instead.
- Annotation constant `DisableMachineCreate` has been updated to `DisableMachineCreateAnnotation`
- Below Label constant have been updated
  - `ClusterLabelName` to `ClusterNameLabel`
  - `ClusterTopologyMachineDeploymentLabelName` to `ClusterTopologyMachineDeploymentNameLabel`
  - `ProviderLabelName` to `ProviderNameLabel`
  - `MachineControlPlaneLabelName` to `MachineControlPlaneLabel`
  - `MachineSetLabelName` to `MachineSetNameLabel`
  - `MachineDeploymentLabelName` to `MachineDeploymentNameLabel`
- Below Condition and Reason constants have been updated
  - `ExternalRemediationTemplateAvailable` to `ExternalRemediationTemplateAvailableCondition`
  - `ExternalRemediationTemplateNotFound` to `ExternalRemediationTemplateNotFoundReason`
  - `ExternalRemediationRequestAvailable` to  `ExternalRemediationRequestAvailableCondition`
  - `ExternalRemediationRequestCreationFailed` to `ExternalRemediationRequestCreationFailedReason`
- `api/v1beta1.MachineDeployment.Default` func has been replaced through `api/v1beta1.MachineDeploymentDefaulter`

### Other

- clusterctl now emits an error for provider CRDs which don't comply with the CRD naming conventions. This warning can be skipped for resources not referenced by Cluster API
  core resources via the `clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/skip-crd-name-preflight-check` annotation. The contracts specify:
  > The CRD name must have the format produced by sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/util/contract.CalculateCRDName(Group, Kind)
- `clusterctl upgrade apply` no longer requires a namespace when updating providers. It is now optional and in a future release it will be deprecated. The new syntax is `[namespace/]provider:version`.
- `WatchDeploymentLogs` is changed to `WatchDeploymentLogsByName`, it works same as before. Another function `WatchDeploymentLogsByLabelSelector` is added to stream logs of deployment by label selector.
- Cluster API controllers are now using an explicit security context by default.
- It is recommended to drop usages of `logs.AddFlags(fs, logs.SkipLoggingConfigurationFlags())`. It was previously used to configure deprecated logging flags, but with the bump to component-base
  `v0.26.0` this function is not configuring any flags anymore.
  Please note that the following logging flags have been removed: (in `component-base`, but this affects all CAPI controllers): `--add-dir-header`, `--alsologtostderr`, `--log-backtrace-at`,
  `--log-dir`, `--log-file`, `--log-file-max-size`, `--logtostderr`, `--one-output`, `--skip-headers`, `--skip-log-headers` and `--stderrthreshold`.
  For more information, please see: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2845
- A new `KCPRemediationSpec` test has been added providing better test coverage for KCP remediation most common use cases. As a consequence `MachineRemediationSpec` now only tests remediation of
  worker machines (NOTE: we plan to improve this test as well in a future iteration).
- Package `test/infrastructure/docker/internal/third_party/forked/loadbalancer` has been moved to `test/infrastructure/docker/internal/loadbalancer` to allow it to diverge from the upstream Kind package.

### Suggested changes for providers

- Providers should add an explicit security context to their controllers deployment, see [#7831](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/7831) for reference.
