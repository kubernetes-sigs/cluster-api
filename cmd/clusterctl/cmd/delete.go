		# providers
		# Important! As a consequence of this operation, all the corresponding resources managed by
		# the AWS infrastructure provider and Cluster API Providers are orphaned and there might be
		# ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.

		# Delete the AWS infrastructure provider and related CRDs. Please note that this forces deletion of

		# Important! As a consequence of this operation, all the corresponding resources managed by
		# the AWS infrastructure provider are orphaned and there might be ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.
