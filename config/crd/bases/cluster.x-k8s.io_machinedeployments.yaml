                      template defines the template to use for generating the names of the
                      Machine objects.
                      If not defined, it will fallback to `{{ .machineSet.name }}-{{ .random }}`.
                      If the generated name string exceeds 63 characters, it will be trimmed to
                      58 characters and will
                      get concatenated with a random suffix of length 5.
                      Length of the template string must not exceed 256 characters.
                      The template allows the following variables `.cluster.name`,
                      `.machineSet.name` and `.random`.
                      The variable `.cluster.name` retrieves the name of the cluster object
                      that owns the Machines being created.
                      The variable `.machineSet.name` retrieves the name of the MachineSet
                      object that owns the Machines being created.
                      The variable `.random` is substituted with random alphanumeric string,
                      without vowels, of length 5. This variable is required part of the
                      template. If not provided, validation will fail.

                  process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded

                  * On an existing MachineDeployment the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
                  Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
                  * A new MachineDeployment is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineDeployment which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
                    should be later controlled by the autoscaler

                      remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                      and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.

                        description: |-
                          maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                          Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                          older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                          Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                          prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                          MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                          Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                          the desired replicas.

                          If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                          under the active MachineSet's management.

                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.

                    description: |-
                      maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                      Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                      older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                      Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                      prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                      MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                      Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                      the desired replicas.

                      If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                      under the active MachineSet's management.

                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is > max size, use max size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMD
                  * otherwise use 1
                  Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:

                  * On an existing MachineDeployment the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
                  Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
                  * A new MachineDeployment is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineDeployment which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
                    should be later controlled by the autoscaler

                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.
