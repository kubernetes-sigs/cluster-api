                          controllers to do what they will with the defined failure domains.

                              no checks to ensure the validity of the configuration. This template will support the following variables that will be passed by the controller:
                              $IPv6 (bool) indicates if the cluster is IPv6, $FrontendControlPlanePort (string) indicates the frontend control plane port,
                              $BackendControlPlanePort (string) indicates the backend control plane port, $BackendServers (map[string]string) indicates the backend server
                              where the key is the server name and the value is the address. This map is dynamic and is updated every time a new control plane
                              node is added or removed. The template will also support the JoinHostPort function to join the host and port of the backend server.

                                can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
