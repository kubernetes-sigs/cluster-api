# Writing a ClusterClass

A ClusterClass becomes more useful and valuable when it can be used to create many Cluster of a similar 
shape. The goal of this document is to explain how ClusterClasses can be written in a way that they are 
flexible enough to be used in as many Clusters as possible by supporting variants of the same base Cluster shape.

## Basic ClusterClass

The following example shows a basic ClusterClass. It contains templates to shape the control plane, 
infrastructure and workers of a Cluster. When a Cluster is using this ClusterClass, the templates 
are used to generate the objects of the managed topology of the Cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ref:
      apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate
      name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
      namespace: default
    machineInfrastructure:
      ref:
        kind: DockerMachineTemplate
        apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
        namespace: default
  infrastructure:
    ref:
      apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: DockerClusterTemplate
      name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0-control-plane
      namespace: default
  workers:
    machineDeployments:
    - class: default-worker
      template:
        bootstrap:
          ref:
            apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
            kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
            name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0-default-worker
            namespace: default
        infrastructure:
          ref:
            apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
            kind: DockerMachineTemplate
            name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0-default-worker
            namespace: default
```

The following example shows a Cluster using this ClusterClass. In this case a `KubeadmControlPlane` 
with the corresponding `DockerMachineTemplate`, a `DockerCluster` and a `MachineDeployment` with 
the corresponding `KubeadmConfigTemplate` and `DockerMachineTemplate` will be created. This basic 
ClusterClass is already very flexible. Via the topology on the Cluster the following can be configured:
* `.spec.topology.version`: the Kubernetes version of the Cluster
* `.spec.topology.controlPlane`: ControlPlane replicas and their metadata
* `.spec.topology.workers`: MachineDeployments and their replicas, metadata and failure domain

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-docker-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    class: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
    version: v1.22.4
    controlPlane:
      replicas: 3
      metadata:
        labels:
          cpLabel: cpLabelValue 
        annotations:
          cpAnnotation: cpAnnotationValue
    workers:
      machineDeployments:
      - class: default-worker
        name: md-0
        replicas: 4
        metadata:
          labels:
            mdLabel: mdLabelValue
          annotations:
            mdAnnotation: mdAnnotationValue
        failureDomain: region
```

Best practices:
* The ClusterClass name should be generic enough to make sense across multiple clusters, i.e. a 
  name which corresponds to a single Cluster, e.g. "my-cluster", is not recommended.
* Try to keep the ClusterClass names short and consistent (if you publish multiple ClusterClasses).
* As a ClusterClass usually evolves over time and you might want to rebase Clusters from one version 
  of a ClusterClass to another, consider including a version suffix in the ClusterClass name.
  For more information about changing a ClusterClass please see: [Changing a ClusterClass].
* Prefix the templates used in a ClusterClass with the name of the ClusterClass.
* Don't reuse the same template in multiple ClusterClasses. This is automatically taken care
  of by prefixing the templates with the name of the ClusterClass.

<aside class="note">

For a full example ClusterClass for CAPD you can take a look at
[clusterclass-quickstart.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/test/infrastructure/docker/templates/clusterclass-quick-start.yaml)
(which is also used in the CAPD quickstart with ClusterClass).

<h1>Tip: clusterctl alpha topology plan</h1>

The `clusterctl alpha topology plan` command can be used to test ClusterClasses; the output will show
you how the resulting Cluster will look like, but without actually creating it.
For more details please see: [clusterctl alpha topology plan].

## ClusterClass with MachinePools

ClusterClass also supports MachinePool workers. They work very similar to MachineDeployments. MachinePools
can be specified in the ClusterClass template under the workers section like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  workers:
    machinePools:
    - class: default-worker
      template:
        bootstrap:
          ref:
            apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
            kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
            name: quick-start-default-worker-bootstraptemplate
        infrastructure:
          ref:
            apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
            kind: DockerMachinePoolTemplate
            name: quick-start-default-worker-machinepooltemplate
```

They can then be similarly defined as workers in the cluster template like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-docker-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    workers:
      machinePools:
      - class: default-worker
        name: mp-0
        replicas: 4
        metadata:
          labels:
            mpLabel: mpLabelValue
          annotations:
            mpAnnotation: mpAnnotationValue
        failureDomain: region
```

## ClusterClass with MachineHealthChecks

`MachineHealthChecks` can be configured in the ClusterClass for the control plane and for a 
MachineDeployment class. The following configuration makes sure a `MachineHealthCheck` is 
created for the control plane and for every `MachineDeployment` using the `default-worker` class.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ...
    machineHealthCheck:
      maxUnhealthy: 33%
      nodeStartupTimeout: 15m
      unhealthyConditions:
      - type: Ready
        status: Unknown
        timeout: 300s
      - type: Ready
        status: "False"
        timeout: 300s
  workers:
    machineDeployments:
    - class: default-worker
      ...
      machineHealthCheck:
        unhealthyRange: "[0-2]"
        nodeStartupTimeout: 10m
        unhealthyConditions:
        - type: Ready
          status: Unknown
          timeout: 300s
        - type: Ready
          status: "False"
          timeout: 300s
```

## ClusterClass with patches

As shown above, basic ClusterClasses are already very powerful. But there are cases where 
more powerful mechanisms are required. Let's assume you want to manage multiple Clusters 
with the same ClusterClass, but they require different values for a field in one of the 
referenced templates of a ClusterClass.

A concrete example would be to deploy Clusters with different registries. In this case, 
every cluster needs a Cluster-specific value for `.spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration.imageRepository` 
in `KubeadmControlPlane`. Use cases like this can be implemented with ClusterClass patches.

**Defining variables in the ClusterClass**

The following example shows how variables can be defined in the ClusterClass.
A variable definition specifies the name and the schema of a variable and if it is 
required. The schema defines how a variable is defaulted and validated. It supports 
a subset of the schema of CRDs. For more information please see the [godoc](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/cluster.x-k8s.io/ClusterClass/v1beta1#spec-variables-schema-openAPIV3Schema).

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  variables:
  - name: imageRepository
    required: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: string
        description: ImageRepository is the container registry to pull images from.
        default: registry.k8s.io
        example: registry.k8s.io
```

<aside class="note">

<h1>Supported types</h1>

The following basic types are supported: `string`, `integer`, `number` and `boolean`. We are also 
supporting complex types, please see the [complex variable types](#complex-variable-types) section.

</aside>

**Defining patches in the ClusterClass**

The variable can then be used in a patch to set a field on a template referenced in the ClusterClass.
The `selector` specifies on which template the patch should be applied. `jsonPatches` specifies which JSON 
patches should be applied to that template. In this case we set the `imageRepository` field of the 
`KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate` to the value of the variable `imageRepository`. For more information 
please see the [godoc](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/cluster.x-k8s.io/ClusterClass/v1beta1#spec-patches-definitions).

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: imageRepository
    definitions:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: KubeadmControlPlaneTemplate
        matchResources:
          controlPlane: true
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/kubeadmConfigSpec/clusterConfiguration/imageRepository
        valueFrom:
          variable: imageRepository
```

<aside class="note">

<h1>Writing JSON patches</h1>

* Only fields below `/spec` can be patched.
* Only `add`, `remove` and `replace` operations are supported.
* It's only possible to append and prepend to arrays. Insertions at a specific index are 
  not supported.
* Be careful, appending or prepending an array variable to an array leads to a nested array
  (for more details please see this [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/5944)).

</aside>

**Setting variable values in the Cluster**

After creating a ClusterClass with a variable definition, the user can now provide a value for 
the variable in the Cluster as in the example below.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-docker-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    ...
    variables:
    - name: imageRepository
      value: my.custom.registry
```

<aside class="note">

<h1>Variable defaulting</h1>

If the user does not set the value, but the corresponding variable definition in ClusterClass has
a default value, the value is automatically added to the variables list.

</aside>

## ClusterClass with custom naming strategies

The controller needs to generate names for new objects when a Cluster is getting created
from a ClusterClass. These names have to be unique for each namespace. The naming
strategy enables this by concatenating the cluster name with a random suffix.

It is possible to provide a custom template for the name generation of ControlPlane, MachineDeployment
and MachinePool objects.

The generated names must comply with the [RFC 1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names) standard.

### Defining a custom naming strategy for ControlPlane objects

The naming strategy for ControlPlane supports the following properties:

- `template`: Custom template which is used when generating the name of the ControlPlane object.

The following variables can be referenced in templates:

- `.cluster.name`: The name of the cluster object.
- `.random`: A random alphanumeric string, without vowels, of length 5.

Example which would match the default behavior:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ...
    namingStrategy:
      template: "{{ .cluster.name }}-{{ .random }}"
  ...
```

### Defining a custom naming strategy for MachineDeployment objects

The naming strategy for MachineDeployments supports the following properties:

- `template`: Custom template which is used when generating the name of the MachineDeployment object.

The following variables can be referenced in templates:

- `.cluster.name`: The name of the cluster object.
- `.random`: A random alphanumeric string, without vowels, of length 5.
- `.machineDeployment.topologyName`: The name of the MachineDeployment topology (`Cluster.spec.topology.workers.machineDeployments[].name`)

Example which would match the default behavior:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ...
  workers:
    machineDeployments:
    - class: default-worker
      ...
      namingStrategy:
        template: "{{ .cluster.name }}-{{ .machineDeployment.topologyName }}-{{ .random }}"
```

### Defining a custom naming strategy for MachinePool objects

The naming strategy for MachinePools supports the following properties:

- `template`: Custom template which is used when generating the name of the MachinePool object.

The following variables can be referenced in templates:

- `.cluster.name`: The name of the cluster object.
- `.random`: A random alphanumeric string, without vowels, of length 5.
- `.machinePool.topologyName`: The name of the MachinePool topology (`Cluster.spec.topology.workers.machinePools[].name`).

Example which would match the default behavior:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ...
  workers:
    machinePools:
    - class: default-worker
      ...
      namingStrategy:
        template: "{{ .cluster.name }}-{{ .machinePool.topologyName }}-{{ .random }}"
```

## Advanced features of ClusterClass with patches

This section will explain more advanced features of ClusterClass patches.

### MachineDeployment & MachinePool variable overrides

If you want to use many variations of MachineDeployments in Clusters, you can either define
a MachineDeployment class for every variation or you can define patches and variables to
make a single MachineDeployment class more flexible. The same applies for MachinePools.

In the following example we make the `instanceType` of a `AWSMachineTemplate` customizable.
First we define the `workerMachineType` variable and the corresponding patch:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: aws-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  variables:
  - name: workerMachineType
    required: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: string
        default: t3.large
  patches:
  - name: workerMachineType
    definitions:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: AWSMachineTemplate
        matchResources:
          machineDeploymentClass:
            names:
            - default-worker
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/instanceType
        valueFrom:
          variable: workerMachineType
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: AWSMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: aws-clusterclass-v0.1.0-default-worker
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      # instanceType: workerMachineType will be set by the patch.
      iamInstanceProfile: "nodes.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io"
---
...
```

In the Cluster resource the `workerMachineType` variable can then be set cluster-wide and
it can also be overridden for an individual MachineDeployment or MachinePool.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-aws-cluster
spec:
  ...
  topology:
    class: aws-clusterclass-v0.1.0
    version: v1.22.0
    controlPlane:
      replicas: 3
    workers:
      machineDeployments:
      - class: "default-worker"
        name: "md-small-workers"
        replicas: 3
        variables:
          overrides:
          # Overrides the cluster-wide value with t3.small.
          - name: workerMachineType
            value: t3.small
      # Uses the cluster-wide value t3.large.
      - class: "default-worker"
        name: "md-large-workers"
        replicas: 3
    variables:
    - name: workerMachineType
      value: t3.large
```

### Builtin variables

In addition to variables specified in the ClusterClass, the following builtin variables can be 
referenced in patches:
- `builtin.cluster.{name,namespace}`
- `builtin.cluster.topology.{version,class}`
- `builtin.cluster.network.{serviceDomain,services,pods,ipFamily}`
    - Note: ipFamily is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/7521.
- `builtin.controlPlane.{replicas,version,name}`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when patching control plane or control plane 
      machine templates.
- `builtin.controlPlane.machineTemplate.infrastructureRef.name`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when using a control plane with machines and 
      when patching control plane or control plane machine templates.
- `builtin.machineDeployment.{replicas,version,class,name,topologyName}`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when patching the templates of a MachineDeployment 
      and contain the values of the current `MachineDeployment` topology.
- `builtin.machineDeployment.{infrastructureRef.name,bootstrap.configRef.name}`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when patching the templates of a MachineDeployment
      and contain the values of the current `MachineDeployment` topology.
- `builtin.machinePool.{replicas,version,class,name,topologyName}`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when patching the templates of a MachinePool 
      and contain the values of the current `MachinePool` topology.
- `builtin.machinePool.{infrastructureRef.name,bootstrap.configRef.name}`
    - Please note, these variables are only available when patching the templates of a MachinePool
      and contain the values of the current `MachinePool` topology.

Builtin variables can be referenced just like regular variables, e.g.:
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: clusterName
    definitions:
    - selector:
      ...
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/kubeadmConfigSpec/clusterConfiguration/controllerManager/extraArgs/cluster-name
        valueFrom:
          variable: builtin.cluster.name
```

**Tips & Tricks**

Builtin variables can be used to dynamically calculate image names. The version used in the patch 
will always be the same as the one we set in the corresponding MachineDeployment or MachinePool 
(works the same way with `.builtin.controlPlane.version`).

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: customImage
    description: "Sets the container image that is used for running dockerMachines."
    definitions:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: DockerMachineTemplate
        matchResources:
          machineDeploymentClass:
            names:
            - default-worker
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/customImage
        valueFrom:
          template: |
            kindest/node:{{ .builtin.machineDeployment.version }}
```

### Complex variable types

Variables can also be objects, maps and arrays. An object is specified with the type `object` and
by the schemas of the fields of the object. A map is specified with the type `object` and the schema 
of the map values. An array is specified via the type `array` and the schema of the array items.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  variables:
  - name: httpProxy
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties: 
          # Schema of the url field.
          url: 
            type: string
          # Schema of the noProxy field.
          noProxy:
            type: string
  - name: mdConfig
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        additionalProperties:
          # Schema of the map values.
          type: object
          properties:
            osImage:
              type: string
  - name: dnsServers
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: array
        items:
          # Schema of the array items.
          type: string
```

Objects, maps and arrays can be used in patches either directly by referencing the variable name,
or by accessing individual fields. For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  jsonPatches:
  - op: add
    path: /spec/template/spec/httpProxy/url
    valueFrom:
      # Use the url field of the httpProxy variable.
      variable: httpProxy.url
  - op: add
    path: /spec/template/spec/customImage
    valueFrom:
      # Use the osImage field of the mdConfig variable for the current MD class.
      template: "{{ (index .mdConfig .builtin.machineDeployment.class).osImage }}"
  - op: add
    path: /spec/template/spec/dnsServers
    valueFrom:
      # Use the entire dnsServers array.
      variable: dnsServers
  - op: add
    path: /spec/template/spec/dnsServer
    valueFrom:
      # Use the first item of the dnsServers array.
      variable: dnsServers[0]
```

**Tips & Tricks**

Complex variables can be used to make references in templates configurable, e.g. the `identityRef` used in `AzureCluster`.
Of course it's also possible to only make the name of the reference configurable, including restricting the valid values 
to a pre-defined enum.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: azure-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  variables:
  - name: clusterIdentityRef
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          kind:
            type: string
          name:
            type: string
```

Even if OpenAPI schema allows defining free form objects, e.g.

```yaml
variables:
  - name: freeFormObject
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
```

User should be aware that the lack of the validation of users provided data could lead to problems
when those values are used in patch or when the generated templates are created (see e.g.
 [6135](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/6135)).

As a consequence we recommend avoiding this practice while we are considering alternatives to make
it explicit for the ClusterClass authors to opt-in in this feature, thus accepting the implied risks.

### Using variable values in JSON patches

We already saw above that it's possible to use variable values in JSON patches. It's also 
possible to calculate values via Go templating or to use hard-coded values.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: etcdImageTag
    definitions:
    - selector:
      ...
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/kubeadmConfigSpec/clusterConfiguration/etcd
        valueFrom:
          # This template is first rendered with Go templating, then parsed by 
          # a YAML/JSON parser and then used as value of the JSON patch.
          # For example, if the variable etcdImageTag is set to `3.5.1-0` the 
          # .../clusterConfiguration/etcd field will be set to:
          # {"local": {"imageTag": "3.5.1-0"}}
          template: |
            local:
              imageTag: {{ .etcdImageTag }}
  - name: imageRepository
    definitions:
    - selector:
      ...
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/kubeadmConfigSpec/clusterConfiguration/imageRepository
        # This hard-coded value is used directly as value of the JSON patch.
        value: "my.custom.registry"
```

<h1>Variable paths</h1>

* Paths can be used in `.valueFrom.template` and `.valueFrom.variable` to access nested fields of arrays and objects.
* `.` is used to access a field of an object, e.g. `httpProxy.url`.
* `[i]` is used to access an array element, e.g. `dnsServers[0]`.
* Because of the way Go templates work, the paths in templates have to start with a dot.

</aside>

**Tips & Tricks**

Templates can be used to implement defaulting behavior during JSON patch value calculation. This can be used if the simple
constant default value which can be specified in the schema is not enough.
```yaml
        valueFrom:
          # If .vnetName is set, it is used. Otherwise, we will use `{{.builtin.cluster.name}}-vnet`.  
          template: "{{ if .vnetName }}{{.vnetName}}{{else}}{{.builtin.cluster.name}}-vnet{{end}}"
```
When writing templates, a subset of functions from [the Sprig library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) can be used to
write expressions, e.g., `{{ .name | upper }}`. Only functions that are guaranteed to evaluate to the same result
for a given input are allowed (e.g. `upper` or `max` can be used, while `now` or `randAlpha` cannot be used).

### Optional patches

Patches can also be conditionally enabled. This can be done by configuring a Go template via `enabledIf`. 
The patch is then only applied if the Go template evaluates to `true`. In the following example the `httpProxy` 
patch is only applied if the `httpProxy` variable is set (and not empty).

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: docker-clusterclass-v0.1.0
spec:
  ...
  variables:
  - name: httpProxy
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: string
  patches:
  - name: httpProxy
    enabledIf: "{{ if .httpProxy }}true{{end}}"
    definitions:
    ...  
```

**Tips & Tricks**:

Hard-coded values can be used to test the impact of a patch during development, gradually roll out patches, etc. .
```yaml
    enabledIf: false
```

A boolean variable can be used to enable/disable a patch (or "feature"). This can have opt-in or opt-out behavior
depending on the default value of the variable.
```yaml
    enabledIf: "{{ .httpProxyEnabled }}"
```

Of course the same is possible by adding a boolean variable to a configuration object.
```yaml
    enabledIf: "{{ .httpProxy.enabled }}"
```

Builtin variables can be leveraged to apply a patch only for a specific Kubernetes version.
```yaml
    enabledIf: '{{ semverCompare "1.21.1" .builtin.controlPlane.version }}'
```

With `semverCompare` and `coalesce` a feature can be enabled in newer versions of Kubernetes for both KubeadmConfigTemplate and KubeadmControlPlane.
```yaml
    enabledIf: '{{ semverCompare "^1.22.0" (coalesce .builtin.controlPlane.version .builtin.machineDeployment.version )}}'
```

<aside class="note">

<h1>Builtin Variables</h1>

Please be aware that while you can use builtin variables, if you use for example a MachineDeployment-specific variable this
can mean that patches are only applied to some MachineDeployments. `enabledIf` is evaluated for each template that should be patched
individually.

### Version-aware patches

In some cases the ClusterClass authors want a patch to be computed according to the Kubernetes version in use.

While this is not a problem "per se" and it does not differ from writing any other patch, it is important 
to keep in mind that there could be different Kubernetes version in a Cluster at any time, all of them
accessible via built in variables:
 
- `builtin.cluster.topology.version` defines the Kubernetes version from `cluster.topology`, and it acts
  as the desired Kubernetes version for the entire cluster. However, during an upgrade workflow it could happen that
  some objects in the Cluster are still at the older version.
- `builtin.controlPlane.version`, represent the desired version for the control plane object; usually this
  version changes immediately after `cluster.topology.version` is updated (unless there are other operations
  in progress preventing the upgrade to start).
- `builtin.machineDeployment.version`, represent the desired version for each specific MachineDeployment object;
  this version changes only after the upgrade for the control plane is completed, and in case of many
  MachineDeployments in the same cluster, they are upgraded sequentially.
- `builtin.machinePool.version`, represent the desired version for each specific MachinePool object;
  this version changes only after the upgrade for the control plane is completed, and in case of many
  MachinePools in the same cluster, they are upgraded sequentially.

This info should provide the bases for developing version-aware patches, allowing the patch author to determine when a
patch should adapt to the new Kubernetes version by choosing one of the above variables. In practice the
following rules applies to the most common use cases:

- When developing a version-aware patch for the control plane, `builtin.controlPlane.version` must be used.
- When developing a version-aware patch for MachineDeployments, `builtin.machineDeployment.version` must be used.
- When developing a version-aware patch for MachinePools, `builtin.machinePool.version` must be used.

**Tips & Tricks**:

Sometimes users need to define variables to be used by version-aware patches, and in this case it is important
to keep in mind that there could be different Kubernetes versions in a Cluster at any time.

A simple approach to solve this problem is to define a map of version-aware variables, with the key of each item
being the Kubernetes version. Patch could then use the proper builtin variables as a lookup entry to fetch 
the corresponding values for the Kubernetes version in use by each object.

## JSON patches tips & tricks

JSON patches specification [RFC6902] requires that the target of
add operation must exist.

As a consequence ClusterClass authors should pay special attention when the following
conditions apply in order to prevent errors when a patch is applied:

* the patch tries to `add` a value to an **array** (which is a **slice** in the corresponding go struct)
* the slice was defined with `omitempty`
* the slice currently does not exist

A workaround in this particular case is to create the array in the patch instead of adding to the non-existing one.
When creating the slice, existing values would be overwritten so this should only be used when it does not exist.

The following example shows both cases to consider while writing a patch for adding a value to a slice.
This patch targets to add a file to the `files` slice of a `KubeadmConfigTemplate` which has [omitempty](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/bootstrap/kubeadm/api/v1beta1/kubeadmconfig_types.go#L54) set.

{{#tabs name:"tab-configuration-patches" tabs:"Add to existing slice,Create slice"}}
{{#tab Add to existing slice}}

This patch **requires** the key `.spec.template.spec.files` to exist to succeed.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: my-clusterclass
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: add file
    definitions:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/files/-
        value:
          content: Some content.
          path: /some/file
---
apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
metadata:
  name: "quick-start-default-worker-bootstraptemplate"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      ...
      files:
      - content: Some other content
        path: /some/other/file
```

{{#/tab }}
{{#tab Create slice}}

This patch would **overwrite** an existing slice at `.spec.template.spec.files`.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterClass
metadata:
  name: my-clusterclass
spec:
  ...
  patches:
  - name: add file
    definitions:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
      jsonPatches:
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/files
        value:
        - content: Some content.
          path: /some/file
---
apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
metadata:
  name: "quick-start-default-worker-bootstraptemplate"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      ...
```
