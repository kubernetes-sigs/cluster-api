                  for the underlying provider.
                  The underlying provider is responsible for the implementation
                  of the template to an infrastructure cluster.

                          If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                          should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                          referencing a part of an object.

                                      Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                      line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
                                      If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
                                      e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"

                                      MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
                                      Example:
                                      "x must be less than max ("+string(self.max)+")"

                                This field is completely optional, when filled, the MachineHealthCheck controller
                                creates a new object from the template referenced and hands off remediation of the machine to
                                a controller that lives outside of Cluster API.

                                    If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                    referencing a part of an object.

                                Remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                                and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.

                                    MaxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                    machines (ex: 10%).
                                    Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                    This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                    Defaults to 0.
                                    Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
                                    down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
                                    starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
                                    down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
                                    that the total number of machines available at all times
                                    during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

                                Template defines the template to use for generating the name of the MachinePool object.
                                If not defined, it will fallback to `{{ .cluster.name }}-{{ .machinePool.topologyName }}-{{ .random }}`.

                                The templating mechanism provides the following arguments:
                                * `.cluster.name`: The name of the cluster object.
                                * `.random`: A random alphanumeric string, without vowels, of length 5.

                                            e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`

                                            Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                            line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
                                            If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
                                            e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"

                                            MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
                                            Example:
