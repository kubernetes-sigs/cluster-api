                  not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are
                  expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages),
                  but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with
                  the Machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that
                  manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would
                  be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are
                  unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself
                  being critically misconfigured. \n Any transient errors that occur
                  during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to
                  the Machine object and/or logged in the controller's output."

                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                      (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                      only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
