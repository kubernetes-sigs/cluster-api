                it to    the Node, and finding the appropriate field in Node.Status.NodeInfo
                \   (which uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes
                some of the dependency on the structure of the Node,    so that if
                the structure of Node.Status.NodeInfo changes, only    machine controllers
                need to be updated, rather than every client    of the Machines API.
                3) There is no other simple way to check the control plane    version.
                A client would have to connect directly to the apiserver    running
                on the target node in order to find out its version."
