                      template defines the template to use for generating the names of the

                      If not defined, it will fallback to `{{ .machineSet.name }}-{{ .random }}`.
                      If the generated name string exceeds 63 characters, it will be trimmed to
                      58 characters and will
                      get concatenated with a random suffix of length 5.
                      Length of the template string must not exceed 256 characters.
                      The template allows the following variables `.cluster.name`,
                      `.machineSet.name` and `.random`.
                      The variable `.cluster.name` retrieves the name of the cluster object
                      that owns the Machines being created.
                      The variable `.machineSet.name` retrieves the name of the MachineSet
                      object that owns the Machines being created.
                      The variable `.random` is substituted with random alphanumeric string,
                      without vowels, of length 5. This variable is required part of the
                      template. If not provided, validation will fail.

              replicas:

                  replicas is the number of desired replicas.
                  This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified.

                  Defaults to:
                  * if the Kubernetes autoscaler min size and max size annotations are set:
                    - if it's a new MachineSet, use min size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is < min size, use min size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is > max size, use max size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMS
                  * otherwise use 1
                  Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:
                  * A new MachineSet is created with replicas not set.
                  * On an existing MachineSet the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
                  Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
                  * A new MachineSet is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineSet which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
                    should be later controlled by the autoscaler

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.

                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those

                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver

                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                                can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

                          replicas, both FailureReason and FailureMessage will be set. FailureReason
                          will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine
                          interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose

                          These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                          controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                          time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                          fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                          the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                          of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                          spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                          responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                          Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                          can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
                          controller's output.
