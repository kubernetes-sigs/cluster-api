	// * if the Kubernetes autoscaler min size and max size annotations are set:
	// - if it's a new MachineSet, use min size
	// - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is < min size, use min size

	// - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMS
	// * otherwise use 1
	// Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:
	// * A new MachineSet is created with replicas not set.
	// * On an existing MachineSet the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
	// Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
	// * A new MachineSet is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
