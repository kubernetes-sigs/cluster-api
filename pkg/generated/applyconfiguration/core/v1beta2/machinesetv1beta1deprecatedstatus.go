	// will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine
	// interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose

	//
	// These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
	// controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
	// time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
	// fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
	// the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
	// of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
	// spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
	// responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.
	//
	// Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
	// can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
	// controller's output.
