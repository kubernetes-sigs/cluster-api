# clusterctl get kubeconfig

This command prints the kubeconfig of an existing workload cluster into stdout.
This functionality is available in clusterctl v0.3.9 or newer.

If the provider generates a separate user specific Kubeconfig, then clusterctl will return it by default.

## Examples

```bash
clusterctl get kubeconfig foo

```bash
clusterctl get kubeconfig foo --namespace bar

Get the kubeconfig of a workload cluster named foo using a specific context bar

```
