                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                                                using the previously defined environment variables in the container and
                                                any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                                the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                                "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                                Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                                exists or not.

                              useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell
                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              This will add about 40KB to userdata

                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                                      Environment variables passed using ExtraEnvs will override any existing environment variables, or *_proxy environment variables that kubeadm adds by default.

                                      Environment variables passed using ExtraEnvs will override any existing environment variables, or *_proxy environment variables that kubeadm adds by default.

                                  fails you may set the desired value here.

                              for an unhealthy machine also fails.\nFor example, given
                              a control plane with three machines M1, M2, M3:\n\n\tM1
                              become unhealthy; remediation happens, and M1-1 is created
                              as a replacement.\n\tIf M1-1 (replacement of M1) has
                              problems while bootstrapping it will become unhealthy,
                              and then be\n\tremediated; such operation is considered
                              a retry, remediation-retry #1.\n\tIf M1-2 (replacement
                              of M1-1) becomes unhealthy, remediation-retry #2 will
                              happen, etc.\n\nA retry could happen only after retryPeriodSeconds
                              from the previous retry.\nIf a machine is marked as
                              unhealthy after minHealthyPeriodSeconds from the previous
                              remediation expired,\nthis is not considered a retry
                              anymore because the new issue is assumed unrelated from
                              the previous one.\n\nIf not set, the remedation will
                              be retried infinitely."
