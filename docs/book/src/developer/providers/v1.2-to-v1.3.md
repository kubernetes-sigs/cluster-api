## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controllers/external.CloneTemplate` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controllers/external.CreateFromTemplate` instead.
- `clusterctl init --list-images` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `clusterctl init list-images` instead.
- The Machine, MachineSet, MachineDeployment, MachineHealthCheck webhooks as well as the KubeadmConfig and KubeadmConfigTemplate webhooks have been moved to their corresponding `webhooks` package. Thus, the following methods on `Machine`, `MachineSet`, `MachineDeployment`, `MachineHealthCheck`, `KubeadmConfig` and `KubeadmConfigTemplate` in `api/v1beta1` are deprecated: `SetupWebhookWithManager`, `Default`, `ValidateCreate`, `ValidateUpdate` and `ValidateDelete`.

### Removals

- `MachinesByCreationTimestamp` type has been removed.
- `ClusterCacheReconciler.Log` has been removed. Use the logger from the context instead.

### Other

- e2e tests are upgraded to use Ginkgo v2 (v2.1.4) and Gomega v1.20.0. Providers who use the test framework from this release will also need to upgrade, because Ginkgo v2 can't be imported alongside v1. Please see the [Ginkgo upgrade guide](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2), and note:
  * the default test timeout has been [changed to 1h](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#timeout-behavior)
  * the `--junit-report` argument [replaces JUnit custom reporter](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#improved-reporting-infrastructure) code
  * see the ["Update tests to Ginkgo v2" PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/6906) for a reference example
