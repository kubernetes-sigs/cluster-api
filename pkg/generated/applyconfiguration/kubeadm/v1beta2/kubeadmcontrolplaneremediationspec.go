// KubeadmControlPlaneRemediationSpecApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the KubeadmControlPlaneRemediationSpec type for use
// with apply.

// KubeadmControlPlaneRemediationSpec controls how unhealthy control plane Machines are remediated.
type KubeadmControlPlaneRemediationSpecApplyConfiguration struct {
	// maxRetry is the Max number of retries while attempting to remediate an unhealthy machine.
	// A retry happens when a machine that was created as a replacement for an unhealthy machine also fails.
	// For example, given a control plane with three machines M1, M2, M3:
	//
	// M1 become unhealthy; remediation happens, and M1-1 is created as a replacement.
	// If M1-1 (replacement of M1) has problems while bootstrapping it will become unhealthy, and then be
	// remediated; such operation is considered a retry, remediation-retry #1.
	// If M1-2 (replacement of M1-1) becomes unhealthy, remediation-retry #2 will happen, etc.
	//
	// A retry could happen only after retryPeriodSeconds from the previous retry.
	// If a machine is marked as unhealthy after minHealthyPeriodSeconds from the previous remediation expired,
	// this is not considered a retry anymore because the new issue is assumed unrelated from the previous one.
	//
	// If not set, the remedation will be retried infinitely.
	MaxRetry *int32 `json:"maxRetry,omitempty"`
	// retryPeriodSeconds is the duration that KCP should wait before remediating a machine being created as a replacement
	// for an unhealthy machine (a retry).
	//
	// If not set, a retry will happen immediately.
	RetryPeriodSeconds *int32 `json:"retryPeriodSeconds,omitempty"`
	// minHealthyPeriodSeconds defines the duration after which KCP will consider any failure to a machine unrelated
	// from the previous one. In this case the remediation is not considered a retry anymore, and thus the retry
	// counter restarts from 0. For example, assuming minHealthyPeriodSeconds is set to 1h (default)
	//
	// M1 become unhealthy; remediation happens, and M1-1 is created as a replacement.
	// If M1-1 (replacement of M1) has problems within the 1hr after the creation, also
	// this machine will be remediated and this operation is considered a retry - a problem related
	// to the original issue happened to M1 -.
	//
	// If instead the problem on M1-1 is happening after minHealthyPeriodSeconds expired, e.g. four days after
	// m1-1 has been created as a remediation of M1, the problem on M1-1 is considered unrelated to
	// the original issue happened to M1.
	//
	// If not set, this value is defaulted to 1h.
